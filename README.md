v1.0 - Initial release

v1.1 - Added insertion sort and fixed a minor bug causing display issues on the edge bars.

v2.0.0 - Overhaul of code supporting the program. Such that:
 - Sorting algorithms swap elements of the array rather than properties of the elements of the arrays. 
 - Internally lines are now referred to as bars.
 - Although to set up the list of bars the x-coordinates are used, they are only used to assign the proper color to the bar. 
 - Enables custom number of bars to be set. 
 - Many other internal changes
 
  In addition, this update introduces merge and heap sorting.
  
v2.1.0 - Adding quick sort.

v2.2.0 - Adding shellsort. 

v2.2.1 - Update to documentation
