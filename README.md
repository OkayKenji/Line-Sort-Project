v1.0 - Initial release

v1.1 - Added insertion sort and fixed a minor bug causing display issues on the edge bars.

v2.0 - Overhaul of code supporting the program. Such that (1) Sorting algorithms swap elements of the array rather then properties of the elements of the arrays. (2) Enables custom number of bars to be set. In addition this update introduces merge and heap sorting.
